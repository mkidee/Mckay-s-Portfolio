# Mckay's Portfolio

## Description

  The goal of this project was to show the skills I have in HTML and CSS by creating a website that I can use in the future as a portfolio in job interviews. Doing this is also excellent practice for myself and to help cement the things I know about these coding languages. 
  
  I wanted to complete this site so that I can come back to it in the future to update it the user experience, and update (or add) the works that are being presented on the site.

## Usage

  I will use this website to show others my work in interviews (or even just for fun:)!) Having a website that will pull up all my best work in one spot will be a nice thing to have in the future.
